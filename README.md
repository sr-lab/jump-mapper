# Jump Mapper
Approximating PIN guess numbers using keypad patterns.

By training a model with an existing breached data set of 4-digit PINs and their frequencies, can we correctly predict the strength of previously unseen PINs using only keypad jumps? Can we extend this to longer PINs without adding any new training data?
